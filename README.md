# Tweet Analysis
Welcome to my 4th class project for UT-Austin's EE422C Software/Data Structures II course.
This program uses Java 8.

### Extracting Tweets from a Server
The program extracts tweets from this URl endpoint: http://kevinstwitterclient2.azurewebsites.net/api/products
and deserializes the data from JSON to an object representation.

### Filtering the Tweets
There are several methods that allow you to search the tweets by the writer, the time it was written, and the content of the tweet!

### Inferring Social Networks
The program analyzes the tweets and returns a list of the largest cliques as well as the k most followed Tweeters.
